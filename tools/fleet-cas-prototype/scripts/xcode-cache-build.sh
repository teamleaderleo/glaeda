#          [PROJECT=<x.xcodeproj>] [SPM=<cloned packages dir>] [DD=<path>] \

#
# SPM builds against packages resolved once into that directory, so every
# run (and machine) sees the same package checkouts at the same path.
#
# Each label gets its own DerivedData and local CAS under $WORK, so a second
# label is a "fresh machine" whose only warm source is whatever the extra
# settings point at (a shared local CAS path or a remote service socket).
# Prefix mapping keeps cache keys independent of the DerivedData path.
#
# With DD=<path>, every label builds in that one DerivedData path and one
# local CAS path ($WORK/localcas), both emptied first; they must be the same
# absolute paths on every machine. Keys match without mapping DerivedData,
# which avoids a Swift 6.2 (Xcode 26.3) compiler crash the mapping triggers.
# The fixed CAS path matters for targets with a bridging header: the
# bridging-header PCH key includes the local CAS path, and every Swift
# compile in the target carries that key.
