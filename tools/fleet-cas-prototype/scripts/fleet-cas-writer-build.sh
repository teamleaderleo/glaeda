# Run the trusted writer's build, then publish the per-commit marker only if
# every write reached the fleet store (#1134 M3).
#
# usage: fleet-cas-writer-build.sh REPO COMMIT -- BUILD COMMAND...
#
# Runs on the writer host, whose node daemon signs every index entry. The
# marker `REPO/COMMIT/<Xcode build version>` tells workers the fleet store
# holds that commit (fleet-cas-marker.sh). A build that succeeds while some
# writes failed (store down, refused, backing off) leaves the store partly
# filled: it gets no marker, and the next main build fills the rest.
# Settings come from /Users/Shared/cmux-build-fleet/xcode/fleet-cas.env, which
# `glaeda-fleet-cas writer` installs. The build command must add the plugin
# settings from `fleet-cas-settings.sh`. Exit: the build's code; 3 if the node
# is down (nothing is built); 4 if the build passed but no marker was written.
# The writer node keeps its own copy of what it wrote, so a fleet store that is
# emptied needs the writer's node store emptied too, or later markers can
# claim entries the store lost. The build must use the fixed local CAS
# ($ROOT/cas), which this script empties first: an entry whose upload failed
# could otherwise be answered from it and never uploaded again (not observed;
# how Xcode orders local and remote lookups is unverified). The writer's node
# store keeps the writer's own builds fast.
