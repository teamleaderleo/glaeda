# Blazingly hot execution

Glaeda should make useful compute begin with as little repeated setup as possible.

> **Disposable is a capability. Trust decides residency.**

This document is the current high-level map for hot execution. The general product boundary lives in [`COMPUTE_RUNTIME.md`](COMPUTE_RUNTIME.md). The detailed resident project/runtime continuation lives in [`M6_HOT_RUNTIME_HANDOFF.md`](M6_HOT_RUNTIME_HANDOFF.md). Current code and accepted issue/PR decisions win over either document when they move ahead.

## Product objective

The universal objective is **time from declared work to a useful accepted result**, together with throughput and resource cost under exact trust and correctness constraints.

Useful common metrics include:

- request-to-first-useful-compute;
- request-to-first-useful-output;
- request-to-final-accepted-result;
- workload completion wall time;
- fleet throughput under concurrency;
- CPU/RAM/storage/network/accelerator occupancy where relevant;
- hot-state hit/miss/reset benefit;
- recovery time after interruption.

Coding agents, GitHub Actions, edit/test/build loops, and repository verification are major current proving workloads. They add important workload-specific metrics such as edit-to-first-test, edit-to-build, verification completion, and multi-agent fan-out. Those workloads do not define the outer product boundary.

## Current execution model

Glaeda tries to do every reusable, trustworthy piece of preparation before the workload needs it.

```text
work becomes known
-> identify exact workload, trust, inputs, and capabilities
-> select eligible compute and the hottest valid reusable state
-> admit capacity
-> materialize only what must change
-> execute
-> return useful outputs / evidence
-> retain, reset, migrate, quarantine, or destroy state
-> recover from exact durable truth after interruption
```

For hostile or unknown work, the quickest safe path may still be a fresh worker. For trusted repeated work, the quickest path may be a prepared environment or warm pool. For ultra-trusted work, the winning optimization is often to keep valuable state resident.

## The leading resident Linux path

For the current development/CI workload family, the leading trusted path is already more specific than “try a faster filesystem.”

```text

              OverlayFS source view
                     |
                 useful work
```

This is not a custom general-purpose filesystem. Glaeda composes mature Linux filesystem primitives according to the mutation behavior of each state family.

### Mostly-read source state: OverlayFS

OverlayFS is the current leading task-view mechanism for clean resident source fan-out, not a hypothetical later comparator.

The accepted model is roughly:

```text
exact immutable source anchor
+ exact immutable Git object-pool generation
+ task-private Git directory
+ inherited reviewed clean source index
+ unique task upper/work directories
-> exact OverlayFS mount
-> hardened non-mutating Git/source proof
-> task ready
```

The lower source remains immutable for the lifetime of child task leases. Task edits and whiteouts live in the private upper layer. Git refs/config/index/new objects are task-private rather than shared writable metadata.

Owned hosted-ARM evidence recorded in #570/#580 found, for one representative source-view comparison:

```text
tasks    ordinary materialization    OverlayFS + inherited index    ready-state growth
1        ~76.2 ms                    ~15.9 ms                       ~8.05 MiB -> ~4 KiB
8        ~224.3 ms                   ~52.4 ms                       ~64.3 MiB -> ~32 KiB
32       ~695.6 ms                   ~175.2 ms                      ~257.3 MiB -> ~160 KiB
```

All compared views passed the non-mutating Git proof. The source-view model also worked on ext4, so XFS is not a prerequisite for OverlayFS source fan-out.

### Git metadata: private, objects shared immutably

The preferred task path does not rely on one shared writable common Git directory.

A resident immutable object-pool generation supplies base objects while each task gets private refs, config, index, HEAD, and new objects. The current V1 direction uses an explicit reviewed equivalent of:

```text
git clone
  --reference <exact-immutable-pool-generation>
  --no-local
  --no-checkout
  --separate-git-dir <exact-private-task-gitdir>
  --template <reviewed-empty-template>
  <exact-immutable-pool-generation>
  <exact-task-target>
```

The active pool remains frozen and task-unwritable. New/updated pool state is published as a successor generation instead of mutating the active generation in place.

### Write-heavy state: private CoW/reflink lineage

OverlayFS is not the universal answer.

Putting warmed compiler output behind a shared lower can create expensive copy-up. Current measurements showed that clearly: one synthetic eight-task Rust comparison was roughly **5.70 s** with the write-heavy target state behind OverlayFS versus roughly **2.77 s** with task-private reflink/CoW build-state lineage.

The resulting policy direction is path-class-specific:

```text
immutable / mostly-read source and suitable dependency state
-> immutable resident base + OverlayFS task view

write-heavy compiler/build state
-> task-private CoW/reflink lineage where supported

state with no worthwhile reusable parent
-> private empty state

shared mutable cache
-> only under an explicit producer/consumer authority model
```

Do not promote a filesystem primitive because its microbenchmark is attractive. Promote it for the state family where complete useful-result measurements show it wins.

### Ultra-trusted local hot-run prototype

`scripts/hot-run` is a deliberately small Linux developer-loop prototype. It binds a task Git
worktree onto the pathname of a warmed resident worktree. Explicit path-class policies can expose
resident dependencies read-only, give a short-lived task a private OverlayFS upper over warmed
bytes, or retain a task-private directory at the same in-sandbox pathname across repeated edit
loops:

```bash
/path/to/resident/scripts/hot-run \
  --task /path/to/task-worktree \
  --cache target:private-copy \
  -- cargo test --locked --lib --bins
```

The stable-path bind would otherwise hide a linked worktree's common `.git` directory. For this
ultra-trusted prototype, `hot-run` re-exposes that exact common directory through a private
per-invocation mount location and places a read-only pointer over the rebound root's `.git` file.
This makes ordinary Git-aware build and verification commands work without rewriting the task
worktree. It is still linked-common metadata, not the product-grade task-private Git mechanism
owned by #580, and grants no isolation from other trusted users of the same repository.

`native` is an explicit observation-only declaration for a direct same-worktree command: it records
that the named cache is mutated at its ordinary task path, creates no state, and adds no isolation.
It refuses cross-worktree execution so it cannot silently turn a private-cache request into shared
resident mutation.

An unmeasured invocation with explicit resident and task arguments, at most one native-cache
declaration, and no other option first enters a small POSIX front door. It resolves both arguments
to the same physical directory, uses one Git probe to require that directory to be the worktree
root, resolves one absolute executable, changes to that root and waits for the command with the
caller's terminal and environment. Measurement, runtime binding, timeout, resource profile, source
seeding, state, Git environment overrides, cross-worktree execution and every non-native or
ambiguous cache request fall through to the unchanged Python implementation. This is a latency
optimization for work that was already direct; it grants no project identity, residency, cache,
observation, isolation, or result authority.

`glaeda-hot-run` is the compiled Linux front door for the equally common measured direct case:

```bash
glaeda-hot-run \
  --resident /path/to/resident --task /path/to/resident \
  --cache target:native --measurement /private/receipt.json \
  -- cargo check --locked
```

It preserves the schema-v6 measurement shape, workload-scoped GNU-time CPU/RSS boundary, aggregate
machine-pressure envelope, exit-versus-signal distinction, atomic receipt publication, caller
environment and terminal, optional comparison key, runtime executable digest, and optional
descendant-bin binding without starting Python. The binary accepts only a task directory inside the
named physical Git worktree and explicit `native` cache declarations. Its `--runtime-id`,
`--runtime-sha256`, and `--runtime-bin` options preserve the contracts described below, including
PATH-first descendant selection and preflight directory revalidation. On Linux, `--timeout`
places the command and ordinary descendants that remain in its private process group there, observes
the leader through a pidfd, and forwards operator SIGINT or SIGTERM to the group. A wall-clock
deadline sends SIGTERM, allows a two-second exit grace, continues observing the group if its leader
exits first, then escalates any remaining members to SIGKILL; the receipt records exit 124 and
`deadline_exceeded`.
`--resource-profile big-red-heavy` places GNU time and the command inside the existing collected
user-systemd scope with the exact 1,200% CPU, 8/12 GiB memory and 1,024-task limits described below.
The profile and deadline compose without changing either contract. The binary does not yet
implement a cross-worktree stable-path view, state preparation, or source-mtime seeding; those
requests remain on `scripts/hot-run` rather than being silently weakened. This is still an
observation-only ultra-trusted execution path. It grants no lease, cache, residency, validation,
publication, or cleanup authority.

`private` starts with an empty directory and retains the task's later writes without OverlayFS
copy-up. `private-copy` atomically seeds that directory once from the warm resident parent with GNU
`cp --reflink=auto`, then reuses the private lineage on later invocations. The copy uses reflinks
where the backing filesystem supports them and ordinary allocated copies otherwise. A failed copy
never publishes the candidate directory. `overlay` starts from warmed resident bytes and retains
writes in a task-private upper; it remains useful when warm-start value exceeds copy-up cost. `ro`
exposes suitable immutable prepared state without write authority.

This prototype does not independently prove that the resident parent matches the task source or
toolchain, or freeze a parent that another process is still mutating. Its ultra-trusted caller must
supply the right quiesced resident generation and still run a real validator. The closed fan-out
harness now runs its bounded cold-read control with
`--page-cache-treatment resident-target-dontneed`: it fsyncs and advises away only the owned
resident target's regular-file pages before the measured window, records the exact scope, and
makes no claim that the advisory operation creates a globally cold machine. The fan-out-4 warm and
cold-advised controls select `private-copy` as the implicit cross-worktree `target` treatment: its
two-window medians beat Overlay by 6.19% warm and 11.76% cold. Explicit
path policies remain unchanged, so source and suitable dependency paths can still select Overlay
or read-only sharing while same-worktree execution remains explicit `native` observation.

The same closed harness can add `--retained-reuse` to execute the complete validator a second time
against the already-accepted edit and retained task state. Its comparison basis names this as a
distinct state phase, so first materialization and repeated command execution cannot be mixed as
one pressure treatment. This measures the repeated developer loop Glaeda is intended to improve;
it does not skip tests or grant cached-result authority.

For a short steady-state discriminator, `--retained-reuse-windows 3` or `7` keeps the exact
worktrees and state while rerunning the complete validator. Each reuse ordinal has a distinct
comparison key, so sequence position remains visible rather than being collapsed into one generic
warm label. The original single-window flag and receipt field remain compatible views of ordinal
one.

The first fan-out-4 use of that window measured two samples per arm. Complete first-use medians
were 26.55 seconds native, 27.51 seconds private-copy, and 29.43 seconds Overlay. Immediate reuse
fell to 17.92, 19.63, and 18.07 seconds respectively while every task reran and accepted the same
1,343-test validator. Overlay's apparent immediate-reuse advantage did not survive the longer
control. In a subsequent two-sample seven-reuse bracket, private-copy remained cumulatively faster
after every ordinal and completed first use plus seven full replays in 155.52 seconds versus 158.11
seconds for Overlay. Keep private lineage as the write-heavy cross-worktree `target` default through
the tested eight-command lifetime. Overlay remains the mostly-read source/dependency view and saves
about 0.806 GiB / 6.68% of allocated state in this ext4 workload; the evidence does not justify an
automatic lifetime-based switch.

Python and Node projects can explicitly reuse immutable prepared dependencies while keeping build
output private:

```bash
scripts/hot-run --resident /path/to/python-resident --task /path/to/task \
  --cache .venv:ro -- python -m pytest
scripts/hot-run --resident /path/to/node-resident --task /path/to/task \
  --cache node_modules:ro --cache .next:private -- pnpm build
```

A repository wrapper may also bind the front-door runtime before any work begins. For an
ultra-trusted current-runtime loop, the runtime ID alone makes `hot-run` hash the resolved command,
record that exact digest, and keep mutable state in the resulting digest-specific namespace:

```bash
scripts/hot-run --resident /path/to/node-resident --task /path/to/task \
  --cache node_modules:ro --cache .next:private \
  --runtime-id node-current \
  -- /path/to/node ./node_modules/.bin/next build
```

When a repository pins an independently declared generation, add its expected digest to refuse
drift before user work:

```bash
scripts/hot-run --resident /path/to/node-resident --task /path/to/task \
  --cache node_modules:ro --cache .next:private \
  --runtime-id node-v22.23.2-linux-x64 \
  --runtime-sha256 sha256:<exact-executable-digest> \
  -- /path/to/node ./node_modules/.bin/next build
```

Commands that launch descendant shebangs through `PATH` can opt into one stronger local binding:

```bash
scripts/hot-run --resident /path/to/node-resident --task /path/to/task \
  --cache node_modules:ro --cache .next:private \
  --runtime-id node-v26.8.1-linux-x64 \
  --runtime-sha256 sha256:<exact-node-digest> \
  --runtime-bin /path/to/node-v26.8.1-linux-x64/bin \
  -- node ./node_modules/.bin/next build
```

`--runtime-bin` requires a runtime ID, accepts only one absolute canonical plain directory, resolves
the launched executable from that directory, and places the directory first in the inherited
descendant `PATH`. The receipt records only `runtime_bin_first` plus an opaque binding digest; the
private-state namespace also includes that digest, so bound and unbound executions or replaced
directories cannot share mutable lineage. No private path is recorded.

This closes the common `/usr/bin/env node` and package-script shebang path for an explicitly
selected ultra-trusted toolchain. It does not hash the whole toolchain tree, intercept absolute
descendant paths, override explicit language-specific executable variables, identify package
manager semantics, or make mutable runtime bytes hostile-safe. A replaced directory is refused
during preflight; in-place mutation remains the caller's quiescence/generation responsibility.

The runtime ID is optional. When present, `hot-run` resolves the command executable, hashes its
content before launch, records the public ID plus exact observed digest, and places mutable
private/overlay state below a digest-specific opaque namespace. An optional `--runtime-sha256`
turns that observation into an expected-digest check and refuses drift. Supplying a digest without
an ID is invalid.

The two front-door-only forms prevent changed launched bytes from silently sharing one private
build-state lineage. Only the explicit-digest form proves agreement with a separately declared
generation. Without `--runtime-bin`, neither is automatic language-manifest discovery, a claim
about descendant executables, or a hostile-code security boundary. With `--runtime-bin`, only
ordinary descendant `PATH` selection is added. The ultra-trusted caller remains responsible for
declaring the right runtime and preventing in-place executable or toolchain replacement between
observation and execution.

`scripts/hot-observe` is the read-only companion for state that may already be resident. A
repository adapter supplies bounded public labels for canonical input files and prepared-state
anchors; Glaeda hashes the no-follow regular files, verifies shared labels have identical content,
and reports the dependency tree's current entry count plus logical and allocated bytes:

```bash
scripts/hot-observe --output json dependency \
  --project-id example --dependency-root /private/prepared/dependencies \
  --runtime-id node-v22.23.2-linux-x64 \
  --runtime-sha256 sha256:<exact-executable-digest> \
  --parent lock=/private/source/pnpm-lock.yaml \
  --anchor lock=/private/prepared/dependencies/.pnpm/lock.yaml \
  --anchor layout=/private/prepared/dependencies/.modules.yaml
```

The same tool can correlate one Linux TCP listener with the expected owner, workspace directory
inode, executable content, runtime identity, and loopback/any exposure while recording bounded age,
CPU, and RSS observations:

```bash
scripts/hot-observe --output json service \
  --project-id example --service-id web-dev-v1 \
  --workspace /private/task --port 3000 --exposure loopback \
  --runtime-id node-v22.23.2-linux-x64 \
  --runtime-sha256 sha256:<exact-executable-digest>
```

Both documents are path-free and observation-only. They contain no PID, argv, environment, file
name, or command output and grant no adoption, lease, signal, cleanup, cache, or result authority.
`anchor_aligned` proves only the repository-declared anchors, not every dependency byte or package
manager semantic. `physical_match` proves the observed listener/process facts, not which application
protocol or source semantics the process serves. Missing or drifting facts remain ordinary
`absent`, `revalidate_required`, `drift`, or `ambiguous` observations for a later cold/reset/lease
decision.

`--measurement result.json` atomically writes one bounded developer observation containing command
elapsed time, user/system CPU time, peak RSS, exit/signal, completion reason, configured timeout,
cross-worktree mode, relative cache policies, and the optional public runtime contract plus its
path-free descendant-bin binding when selected. A
`private-copy` observation also records whether the lineage was seeded or reused, its copy wall
time, and command-plus-preparation wall time. With `--seed-source-mtimes`, when a task-private
`target` is first seeded, Glaeda compares tracked regular files through beneath-root, no-follow
descriptors and gives only byte-identical, executable-mode-compatible, singly linked task files the
resident file's mtime. This
preserves Cargo freshness
for an ordinary worktree created after its exact warm parent without backdating an edited file.
The caller must already own exact warm-parent proof; the flag creates none. The matching pass is
recorded with bounded counts and time. It never runs on retained state: a
file reverted after a prior task build must remain newer so Cargo can rebuild it. Copy/matching
CPU and RSS are not included in the command resource fields. Measured commands put GNU `time`
immediately around the workload, so CPU and peak RSS cover that command tree without inheriting the
largest child previously used for Git, copying, runtime discovery, or other preparation. Profiled
commands put the same observer inside the resource scope. Commands without `--measurement` remain
unwrapped. The receipt contains no command, output, environment, repository identity, file name,
or private path and grants no verification or result-reuse authority.

The same receipt includes aggregate Linux machine observations immediately before process start and
after process settlement. Fixed kernel interfaces supply online/allowed CPU counts, load averages,
available memory, used/total swap, and CPU/memory/I/O pressure-stall information. Missing,
malformed, oversized, inconsistent, or unavailable facts remain `partial` or `unavailable`; they
are never converted to zero pressure. Observation time stays outside command elapsed/CPU/RSS, and
commands without `--measurement` perform no machine observation. These snapshots name no process,
PID, command, environment, cgroup, repository, or path. They expose benchmark-contamination and
placement evidence only and add no wait, refusal, signal, scheduling, service-control, cleanup,
cache, or result-reuse authority.

The receipt also derives signed available-memory and swap-use deltas plus monotonic PSI cumulative
counter deltas and stall fractions over command elapsed time. These values require complete
before/after endpoints; missing evidence or a counter reset remains `null`. The snapshot envelope
is very slightly wider than child elapsed, so tiny-command fractions are contamination evidence,
not an admission threshold.

This derived machine-observation shape entered hot-run measurement schema version 3. Schema version
4 added one optional caller-owned `comparison_key`: a canonical opaque SHA-256 digest covering the
exact workload/source/toolchain/cache/fan-out basis that the caller already owns. Schema version 5
adds the path-free seed-only source-metadata preparation above and includes its time in total
preparation. Schema version 6 replaces process-lifetime child peak RSS on unprofiled commands with
workload-scoped GNU-time CPU/RSS. The reducer accepts only version 6 so historical version 5 RSS
cannot silently enter the same observed range. The comparison key is accepted only with
`--measurement`, records no command or private input, and grants no semantic, result, cache,
scheduling, or admission authority. Existing version 1 through 5 receipts remain historical
observations; no producer silently relabels them as comparable.

Two or more successful schema-v6 receipts carrying the exact same key can be reduced without a
persistent history service:

```bash
scripts/hot-pressure-shadow --output json \
  --current current.json \
  --baseline earlier-a.json \
  --baseline earlier-b.json
```

The reducer refuses mixed keys, failed/interrupted inputs, symlinks, oversized documents, and
duplicate receipt content. Zero or one distinct baseline reports `insufficient_history`; two or
more report descriptive observed min/max ranges for command-plus-state-preparation latency, command
timing, CPU/RSS, memory/swap deltas, and CPU/memory/I/O PSI fractions. Missing pressure remains
`unknown`.
The shadow finding can describe a current sample as slower and/or higher-pressure than its own
observed range, but it never waits, retries, schedules, admits, routes, cancels, mutates, or claims
statistical confidence. Exact workload semantics and result validation remain with the caller that
constructed the comparison key.

Unscoped commands use child `getrusage`; profiled commands place GNU `time` inside the scope so CPU
and peak RSS describe the workload rather than the `systemd-run` launcher. Force termination can
prevent descendants or the inner timer from reporting complete usage, so those three fields are
explicitly `null` instead of fabricated on deadlines and operator interrupts.

Heavy commands should also use `--timeout SECONDS`. The wall-clock deadline owns the whole command
process group, first requests termination, escalates after a two-second grace period, returns the
conventional status 124, and writes the failure receipt. It keeps observing the owned group when
its leader exits before a descendant, so a signal-ignoring background child cannot escape the
escalation. An operator interrupt similarly returns 130 without a Python traceback and records
`operator_interrupt`. A timeout deliberately creates a separate process group; use the unbounded
mode for commands that require interactive terminal job control.

Heavy local work on the measured machine may opt into `--resource-profile big-red-heavy`. It uses
one collected user systemd scope with a 1,200% CPU quota, 8 GiB memory-high threshold, 12 GiB hard
memory ceiling, and 1,024-task ceiling. The explicitly machine-specific profile reflects big-red's
12-way build point, which was within about 0.4% of 16-way Cargo while leaving interactive and
multi-agent headroom. The profile is never applied to ordinary commands implicitly; an unscoped
no-op avoided even the roughly 0.01-second scope cost.

The task and resident must be worktrees of the same Git repository. Direct same-worktree execution
may declare `native` cache observations; all other explicit modes require the cross-worktree path.
The resident worktree remains the stable compiler pathname, while task source changes remain in the
ordinary task worktree and write-heavy cache writes land in a task-private state directory. Cache
paths must be relative,
unique, non-overlapping directories. One non-blocking task-state lock prevents concurrent use of
the same mutable lineage or linked Git view, including while a private parent is copied. The command
receives the caller's terminal, environment, host filesystem, devices, processes, and network and
returns the child's
status. This is explicitly an ultra-trusted performance tool, not a security boundary or
result-authority mechanism.

Unprivileged bubblewrap maps host identities outside the caller's user namespace to the overflow
identity. Commands that deliberately validate host ownership, mount identity, or other physical
namespace facts must use the ordinary host path and final verifier. The hot path is for compilation,
language tools, repository scripts, and tests whose semantics do not depend on those host facts.

On Ubuntu 26.04.1, Linux 7.0, ext4, Rust 1.97.1, and Glaeda `7f40597`, one bounded G0 probe used the
same `cargo test --locked --lib --bins --no-run` command at four Cargo jobs. A fresh ordinary
worktree/path took about 39–42 seconds to compile. An exact task over a resident target started in
0.03 seconds; after a one-line task edit, the private target upper completed in 9.21 seconds. A
direct unmodified full library/binary test execution was 2.63 seconds. These observations promote
the stable-path/private-upper experiment, not OverlayFS as the final write-heavy storage default.
The resulting script measured 0.05 seconds for no-op Bash and Python commands, 0.13 seconds for an
exact Rust no-run check, and 10.06 seconds after the same one-line edit versus a 37.56-second
path-cold rebuild.

The implicit default task state is an opaque path under the user's cache directory. Its lineage
binds the resident and task paths, cache modes, runtime contract, physical resident/task/common-Git
directory objects, Git administrative directories, and each linked worktree's stable `.git`
pointer-file witness. Reusing the same physical worktrees retains their state; removing and
recreating a worktree at the same pathname selects a fresh state even if the filesystem immediately
recycles its inode. The physical witnesses are revalidated after taking the state lock and again
immediately before launch, so replacement during preparation fails closed.

An explicit `--state` remains caller-owned and can intentionally continue a lineage across
worktree generations. Default-key v1 directories are inert after the v2 transition and are not
adopted or deleted implicitly. All task state is expendable: discarding it or selecting a new empty
`--state` path produces a private cold upper and a normal compiler rebuild. Bubblewrap and kernel
OverlayFS are required for cross-worktree mode; running directly in the resident worktree does not
require either.

## Linux mount path

The privileged OverlayFS mount machinery is also concrete.

The landed executor uses safe Rust through the Linux new mount API with held descriptors:

```text
fsopen("overlay")
-> fsconfig_set_fd(lower)
-> fsconfig_set_fd(upper)
-> fsconfig_set_fd(work)
-> exact second confirmation
-> FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE
-> fsmount
-> move_mount onto exact merged target
-> reopen visible target
-> exact post-mount observation
```

No free-form `/bin/mount` option string is the product interface. Lower/upper/work/merged roles are descriptor-bound. The final safe empty-workdir confirmation is immediately before `FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE`, which physical probes identified as the first observed operation that mutates OverlayFS work state.

Owned ARM measurements recorded mount-only fan-out around **7.7 ms / 23 ms / 62 ms for 1 / 8 / 32 mounts** in the measured path.

The syscall machinery is deliberately separate from production authority. Physical task-view activation still depends on the exact project-disk/filesystem/resident-sandbox correlation and guest-control composition owned by #565/#640/#588/#707/#708.

## Persistent project filesystem

The useful resident project filesystem is Linux-native state, not a macOS checkout projected into the guest hot path.

Current direction:

```text
Mac
  durable control / backend ownership
  Lima/VZ backing storage
        |
        v
Linux guest
  persistent project disk
  ext4/XFS as measured
  native Linux page cache
  source anchors
  Git pools
  package/compiler state
  indexes/services
  task-local OverlayFS/CoW views
```

This keeps Git, package-manager, compiler, index, cleanup, and other filesystem-heavy workload operations on Linux filesystem semantics.

The project disk itself remains working/acceleration state. Its lifecycle is single-writer, generation-bound, revalidated, and recoverable. Disk presence, path names, filesystem UUIDs, mount IDs, and surviving bytes never create ownership or result authority by themselves.

## Storage experiments still worth running

The existence of the current OverlayFS path does not settle the physical storage choice underneath it.

Continue comparing complete workloads across bounded candidates such as:

```text
resident root/ext4
dedicated persistent ext4 project disk
dedicated persistent XFS/reflink project disk
internal storage vs suitable TB5 external storage
```

Measure:

- request/edit-to-first-useful-result;
- source/task-view creation;
- compiler/build-state reuse;
- package/dependency behavior;
- cleanup/reset latency;
- guest allocated blocks;
- Mac backing-file growth;
- CPU/RAM cost;
- concurrency and tail latency;
- recovery after VM/controller interruption.

Block-level dedupe/compression or another filesystem earns a place only when current measurements expose a remaining problem it can plausibly solve.

## Backend programme

Keep project/workload semantics constant while comparing resident execution backends.

Current candidates include Lima/VZ and Apple `container` / Containerization. Native Linux hosts and additional owned fleet nodes remain important reference/target classes.

The meaningful comparison is the complete result path, not blank-environment startup alone:

```text
work becomes known
-> eligible host/backend selected
-> hot state admitted
-> required view/state available
-> useful work starts
-> useful output returns
```

A backend that boots a blank environment quicker can still lose to a resident backend holding valid project/compiler/data state. A better underlying backend should improve Glaeda without redefining Glaeda.

## Parallel preparation

When useful state is not already resident, overlap independent preparation:

```text
work observed
├─ choose host/backend
├─ reserve capacity
├─ materialize/resume execution environment
├─ hydrate missing immutable inputs
├─ resolve reusable state generations
├─ prepare integration-specific handoff where needed
└─ compile workload-specific execution/verification plan
```

Join only at real dependency boundaries.

## Hot-state classes

Do not call every reusable thing “cache.” Distinguish at least:

- **immutable reusable generation** — source/object pools, prepared images, datasets, model assets, derived artifacts;
- **lease-scoped mutable resident state** — project checkout, compiler trees, indexes, databases, resident services;
- **task-local mutable state** — edits, debugging state, private build output, task upper layers;
- **shared mutable state** — only with an explicit producer/consumer and poisoning model;
- **disposable physical cache** — freely evictable optimization state.

Each family needs exact validity parents, resource accounting, reset/revalidation behavior, and a cold reacquisition route when it is classified as rebuildable.

## Correctness rule

Hot state carries performance value. Durable owned facts and fresh exact observation carry execution authority.

When validity or ownership becomes ambiguous:

```text
revalidate
-> reset if required
-> quarantine when current ownership is unclear
-> destroy and reconstruct when cheaper or safer
```

Losing hot state should cost latency and compute, not the ability to decide the next safe action.

## First proving workloads

### Quarry

Use Quarry to exercise:

- persistent Python/research environments;
- edit-to-focused-pytest loops;
- repeated task fan-out;
- data/index residency;
- concurrent independent research jobs;
- host economics across Apple VZ and native Linux references.

### Glaeda

Use Glaeda itself to exercise:

- resident Rust source/task views;
- private Cargo incremental build state;
- `sccache` usefulness;
- immutable Git pools;
- exact one-shot guest-control transactions;
- project-disk and mount recovery;
- cold versus prepared versus resident execution.

### Non-repository compute

The generic workload seam under #770/#773 should also prove that hot admission, capacity, lifecycle, and placement are not repository-only. A bounded dataset transform, render, or similar non-repository workload can use the same execution kernel while its adapter owns result semantics.

## Promotion rule

A hot optimization becomes preferred only when controlled evidence shows a useful complete-loop improvement and its validity/reset contract is explicit.

A promotion receipt should record at least:

```text
workload class
baseline identity
candidate identity
exact validity inputs
p50 / p90 useful-result latency
CPU/RAM/storage effect
concurrency effect
reset/invalidation behavior
fallback path
```

The end state is simple to describe even if the internals are exacting:

> **Keep the useful world hot, materialize only what changed, and let trust decide what may survive.**
