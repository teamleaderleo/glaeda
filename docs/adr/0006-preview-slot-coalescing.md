# ADR 0006: Preview slot coalescing

## Status

Accepted for the exploratory preview layer.

## Context

Agents may push many verified commits during one task. Creating a new external deployment for every push consumes deployment quotas and keeps services alive that nobody needs to inspect.

SmolRunner needs a deterministic decision before any container, route, or provider mutation occurs.

## Decision

A preview request names one explicit slot and one immutable artifact identity. It also declares:

- a validated nonzero container port;
- a typed lease lifetime bounded between one minute and seven days;
- an optional bounded path-only health endpoint with validated percent escapes.

The planner compares the request with current state for the same slot and produces one of three actions:

- `create`: no current preview exists; generation 1 begins;
- `reuse_and_renew`: artifact, port, and health path match; the current generation remains and its lease may be renewed;
- `replace`: runtime inputs changed; the checked generation advances exactly once and the old artifact is retained in the plan for cleanup and audit.

A changed TTL alone renews the existing preview. It never creates another runtime generation.

Current state from another slot fails closed. Generation zero and generation overflow fail closed. Plan fields remain private so callers cannot construct an action, generation, and artifact combination that the planner did not produce. The planner performs no mutation.

## Consequences

- Repeated agent requests for the same verified output consume one preview slot.
- A stable URL may remain attached to the slot while generations change behind it.
- Verification frequency stays independent from deployment frequency.
- Provider choice remains downstream from the same deterministic plan.
- The lease layer owns expiry and renewal; the preview planner owns runtime equivalence and supersession.

## Deferred work

- Durable preview-state documents.
- Authorization for creating or replacing slots.
- Route identity and ownership evidence.
- Health-check execution and readiness timeouts.
- Cleanup ordering across routes, containers, and workspaces.
- Local Podman and external provider adapters.
