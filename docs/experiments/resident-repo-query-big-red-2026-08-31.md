# Resident repository query: Big Red controlled result

Status: `repo-query/v1` merged through PR #977 as `f5f67bd`. The measurements are performance
observations, not source-validity, publication, merge, or result-reuse authority.

## Landed slice

`glaeda-repo-query` runs one fixed request against an explicit canonical checkout and complete
base, head, and expected head-tree object IDs. It returns:

- canonical repository, object format, base, head, head tree, and merge base;
- ancestry, commit count, bounded per-file numstat, and complete-patch digest;
- the patch itself only when it fits the requested ceiling;
- optional literal exact-tree grep, bounded tree blobs, bounded path history, and object facts;
- completeness/omission status plus profile, request, Git-process, byte, and timing identity.

The process boundary clears ambient Git configuration, credentials, hooks, lazy fetch, replacement
objects, external diff/text conversion, pager, submodule recursion, and protocol access. It
reobserves checkout, Git-directory, and origin identity before returning. It accepts no refs,
arbitrary Git arguments, shell, network, fetch, checkout, mutation, publication, retention, or
result-reuse authority. The complete response is capped at 128 KiB.

## Complete review-evidence loop

The Big Red dogfood asked one real next-action question of exact candidate
`697cae359a4389877adbbe9a8225e70ada1ab9f0`, tree
`75429d618ebbd125045c39bd4213993408193acf`: inspect topology/diff, find timed-executor use, read the
complete CLI and CLI-test blobs, inspect `src/process.rs` history, and classify known and missing
objects.

| arm | samples | median | worker-visible/result bytes | outer calls | result |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| GitHub baseline | 3 | 4444 ms | 75,713 after optimistic projection; 227,827 transported | 5 | lacked equivalent missing-object size evidence |
| Glaeda resident | 5 | 39.008 ms internal; 40 ms wrapper | 21,452 | 1 | complete for the registered next action |

The landed path was about 114 times faster, removed four remote calls, and was 71.7% smaller than
the optimistic GitHub projection. Its five internal samples were 38.670, 38.962, 39.008, 50.207,
and 64.603 ms; median maximum RSS was 8,268 KiB. The request used 28 bounded local Git processes
and consumed 95,720 Git stdout bytes without exposing those intermediate results to the worker.

## Direct-local calibration

An independently implemented narrower candidate reproduced the exact PR #974 review facts under a
four-arm rotating serial control: two warmups plus ten measured samples per arm, exact equality of
object coordinates, ancestry, commit count, changed-file facts, aggregate numstat, and normalized
patch hunks.

| arm | median | p90 | model-visible bytes | logical outer calls |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| naive remote | 3431.93 ms | 3760.88 ms | 51,201 | 4 |
| optimized remote | 936.95 ms | 987.56 ms | 4,679 | 1 |
| direct local | 10.51 ms | 11.64 ms | 4,679 | 6 |
| discarded narrow Glaeda candidate | 16.58 ms | 18.60 ms | 5,534 | 1 |

This calibration is not attributed to the broader landed binary. It preserves the important
negative control: a typed wrapper did not make Git faster or smaller. The discarded candidate was
1.58 times slower and 18.27% larger than a perfectly composed local projection. The product win is
one stable, bounded, identity-bearing call that prevents repeated remote reads and procedural
rediscovery.

## Ambient-context deletion

Full-loop validation found that named verification profiles inherited the caller's process umask.
Under ambient `0002`, fixtures became group-writable and safety checks failed; under `0022` they
passed. Verification now binds child file creation to `0022` and records that value in plan and
receipt documents. Agents no longer need to know or reproduce this machine fact.

`AGENTS.md` and the README also delegate the exact required phase argv to
`./scripts/verify required --plan-json`; they no longer carry a duplicated eight-command recipe.
The executable named profile remains the single current procedure.
