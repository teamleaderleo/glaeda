# Fleet compilation cache: prefetch, fail-fast, and where a fresh build's time goes

Follow-up to [the mini-to-mini measurement](fleet-compilation-cache-minis-2026-09-24.md), slice 5
of cmuxterm-hq#573 (#1134 M2). Same minis (M4 Pro, Xcode 26.3), same cmux commit
(`2ae26d1c`), full `cmux` scheme, fixed DerivedData and CAS paths. The fleet store ran on
cmux8s and was unloaded; the reader also ran on cmux8s, because cmux7s was still running a
Chromium fleet job. So there was no network hop between store and reader here: these numbers
isolate the protocol and Xcode's own work, not the LAN.

## Results

| Run | Wall | Upstream calls | Summed upstream time |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| fresh reader, one fetch per object (`--no-prefetch`) | 90.8 s | 25,506 | 226 s |
| fresh reader, closure prefetch | 96.7, 96.3 s | 15,409 | 42, 52 s |
| warm node (nothing fetched) | 85.8 s | 0 | 0 |
| fully cache-hit build with timing summary | 91.3 s | | |
| one-line app-target edit, warm DerivedData, caching on | **451 s** | | whole app target recompiled |

All reader runs: 4,191 of 4,191 cacheable tasks hit.

1. **Prefetch works, but the fetch path is not the bottleneck without a network hop.**
   Fetching each index entry's object closure in one streamed call (`GetClosure`, a glaeda
   extension served beside the LLVM services) removed every per-object fetch (17,801 to 0) and
   cut summed upstream time about 5x, yet both prefetch runs were about 6 s *slower* than the
   single run without it (96.5 s against 90.8 s). A likely cause: the node fetches the closure
   before it answers the index lookup, so each lookup waits for its whole closure; returning
   the entry first and prefetching behind it is the next change. The earlier 132 s differs in
   two ways at once (the store host was loaded by a Chromium build, and the store was across
   the LAN), so it does not separate load from network. Prefetch stays for off-LAN members,
   where RTT multiplies with 25,000 calls; a remote-member measurement has to prove it.
2. **A fully cache-hit fresh build is Xcode's own work.** Build timing summary (summed task
   time, not wall): `SwiftDriver` 163 s over 90 tasks (dependency scanning and planning,
   not cached, redone in every fresh DerivedData), `SwiftCompile` 97 s over 3,626 replays,
   script phases 18 s (Rust sidecar, nucleo FFI, wireguard-go), `ExtractAppIntentsMetadata`
   16 s over 89 tasks, link 6 s. A faster cache cannot take this below about 80 s; the levers
   are persistent DerivedData (planning and scans are then incremental), caching the script
   phases' outputs, and skipping App Intents extraction for modules without intents.
3. **With compilation caching on, the app target has no incremental builds.** A one-line edit
   to one app-target file, from a warm DerivedData and a warm node, took 451 s: all 5,310 of the
   `cmux` target's compile steps ran again (the same count as a full build), and none in any
   other target. Each compile job's key covers the
   module's sources, so any edit misses every job in the module. (The Air Blue campaign saw
   the same on Xcode 27: 604 s against 48 s with caching off.) Consequence for "<1 min
   day-to-day": the fleet cache is for fresh machines and for catching up after main moves;
   an edit loop on the app target needs a warm DerivedData with caching off, or a smaller app
   module (manaflow-ai/cmux#13108).
4. **The dangling-entry counter was measuring nothing.** Xcode's index values are its own
   nested record; each output appears as a pair of the plugin's 65-byte ID and the store's
   32-byte ID, several levels down. The prototype only looked for top-level 32-byte values, so
   `kv_put_dangling` and the first prefetch attempt saw no IDs at all. Both now walk the
   nested record (any 32-byte field counts, so the counter can over-count, never under-count).
   An offline walk of the full-app fleet store after the fill found 7,705 entries with 25,031
   references, none to an absent object. That shows the end state, not the order of arrival;
   ordering follows from write-through by design, and the fixed counter will measure it on the
   next fill. The earlier doc's evidence is corrected there.

## Also in this change

- `scripts/fleet-cas-settings.sh <socket>` prints the plugin build settings only if the node
  daemon accepts a connection on its socket (exit 1 otherwise). `xcode-cache-build.sh` applies
  the same check and drops the plugin settings when the node is down, instead of the 400 s
  crawl. Build wrappers on the fleet should do the same.
- Fleet path convention (agreed for cmuxterm-hq#573; `glaeda-mini-fleet check` reports it):
  DerivedData `/Users/Shared/cmux-build-fleet/xcode/DerivedData`, CAS
  `/Users/Shared/cmux-build-fleet/xcode/cas`, node socket
  `/Users/Shared/cmux-build-fleet/xcode/fleet-cas.sock`, node store
  `/Users/Shared/cmux-build-fleet/xcode/node-store`. Moving jobs from per-job `job-volumes`
  DerivedData to that path is a worker and recipe change in cmuxterm-hq build-fleet.
- `REQUIRE_NODE=1` makes the harness fail instead of silently building without the node;
  `reader-runs.sh` sets it, so a measurement cannot quietly lose its cache.
- The fleet store bounds the unauthenticated closure RPC (4,096 roots per call, 64 walks in
  flight), and the node bounds a whole prefetch to 30 s plus HTTP/2 keepalives, because the
  per-call timeout does not cover a streamed body.
- Still owed: the cross-machine full-app read (cmux7s reading from cmux8s), and a
  remote-member run with real RTT, which is where prefetch should show.
