# Fleet-shared Xcode compilation cache: first measurements

Status: **feasible**. A fresh machine building a real cmux package chain went from 118 s cold to
30 to 33 s when its only warm source was a shared cache service, with byte-identical compiler
outputs. One apparent blocker turned out to be an Xcode bug limited to symlinked build paths
(swiftlang/swift#92545). Two design requirements remain: the protocol assumes a same-host service,
and index entries can point at missing objects. Design and plan: #1134. Prior art:
[`docs/research/fleet-cache-prior-art.md`](../research/fleet-cache-prior-art.md).

## Question

Can every machine in a fleet read one shared compiler cache, so a fresh or disposable machine
builds at close to warm speed, while only trusted builders can write what others will trust?

Today cmux CI shares compilation caches as whole tarballs: `nightly.yml` is the single writer,
saves at most 5 GiB, and pull requests restore all of it. #1068 shares finished products. Neither
shares individual compiler outputs live.

## Mechanism

Xcode 27 (`27A266a`) can send compilation-cache traffic to a remote service:
`COMPILATION_CACHE_ENABLE_PLUGIN=YES` plus `COMPILATION_CACHE_REMOTE_SERVICE_PATH=<unix socket>`,
through the bundled `usr/lib/libToolchainCASPlugin.dylib`. The socket speaks LLVM's open
compilation-caching gRPC protocol (swiftlang/llvm-project
`llvm/lib/RemoteCachingService/RemoteCacheProto`), with two services:

| Service | Calls | Holds | Trust |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cas.v1.CASDBService` | `Put`, `Get`, `Save`, `Load` | content-addressed objects | server computes each ID from content, so writes cannot impersonate |
| `keyvalue.v1.KeyValueDB` | `GetValue`, `PutValue` | cache key → result | the only poisoning surface |

So the trust split is narrow: anyone may upload objects, only trusted builders may write
index entries. (One caveat for the real service: a `CASBytes.file_path` upload makes the service read a
local path chosen by the client, so the node daemon must accept file paths only from its own
local clients and only inside their build directories.)

The prototype is [`tools/fleet-cas-prototype`](../../tools/fleet-cas-prototype): about 300
lines of Rust (tonic), one file per object, SHA-256 IDs, damaged objects read as misses,
first-writer-wins index entries, and an optional read-only index.

## Setup

- Air Blue: Apple M5, 10 cores, 24 GiB, macOS 26.6.2, Xcode 27.0 (27A266a).
- Source: cmux `2ae26d1c7dff6a91104d23258b395f3b1b6940e9` (`upstream/main`),
  `Packages/` extracted with `git archive` into scratch, with no working-tree changes to the shared checkout.
- Workload: `CmuxSettingsUI` scheme (CmuxSettingsUI, CmuxSettings, CmuxFoundation,
  CMUXMobileCore; 600 Swift source files), `xcodebuild build`, Debug, macOS.
- Each run uses its own new DerivedData path and its own empty local CAS. Prefix mapping
  (`SWIFT/CLANG_ENABLE_PREFIX_MAPPING`, `…_PROJECT_PREFIX_MAPPING`,
  `…_OTHER_PREFIX_MAPPINGS=<DerivedData>=/^derived`) keeps keys path-independent.
- Harness: [`xcode-cache-build.sh`](../../tools/fleet-cas-prototype/scripts/xcode-cache-build.sh).
  Hits and misses are counted from Xcode's own `cache hit` / `cache miss` remarks.
  Xcode emits these per cache query, not per compile step, and a filling build queries more
  (348 remarks) than a replaying one (190), so compare hit/miss ratios within a row, not
  counts across rows.

## Results

| Run | Warm source | Wall | Hits / misses | Notes |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| cold | none (caching off) | 118.4 s | – | baseline |
| fill | empty service | 131.2 s | 10 / 338 | +11% to compute keys and upload 201 MB |
| fresh 1 | service only | **33.3 s** | 189 / 1 | 3.6x faster than cold |
| fresh 2 | service only | **30.1 s** | 190 / 0 | 3.9x |

`SWIFT_SUPPRESS_WARNINGS=YES` was set for these four runs (see blocker 1).
Store after the fill: 177 MB, 1,674 objects, 716 index entries. The remaining ~30 s is
work the cache does not cover: package resolution, dependency scanning, build planning,
linking, and bundle steps.

### Correctness and failure checks

- **Identical outputs.** On a synthetic three-module package, every product file from the
  service-fed build (including each `.swiftmodule`) and a sampled per-file object were
  byte-identical to the build that filled it. Only the three linked per-product `.o` files
  differed; linking is not cached and embeds paths.
- **Read-only client.** A build with one changed module against `--read-only-kv` succeeded:
  unchanged modules hit (24), the changed module compiled locally, and all 13 index writes
  were refused. Xcode shows each refusal as a warning, not an error.
- **Corruption.** With every stored object's bytes flipped, the next build had 0 hits, compiled
  everything locally, and succeeded. Xcode also checks for itself: it reported
  `failed to update cache: cache poisoned` for mismatched results and did not use them.
  Before the fix, a re-upload did not replace a damaged object. Now it does.

## Blockers and requirements found

1. **Xcode 27 build-service crash replaying some cached warnings (not a fleet blocker).**
   A fresh DerivedData replaying `CmuxFoundation` from a warm cache crashed `SWBBuildService`
   (`SIGABRT`, `std::bad_optional_access` in
   `swift::FileSpecificDiagnosticConsumer::subconsumerForLocation`, from
   `swift::CachingDiagnosticsProcessor::replayCachedDiagnostics`). Follow-up isolated it: it
   needs a build under a symlinked path (`/tmp`, `/private/tmp`, or `$TMPDIR` under
   `/var/folders`), project prefix mapping, a resource bundle, and a warning in a multi-file
   batch. Xcode maps SRCROOT as `/tmp/...` while SwiftPM passes sources as `/private/tmp/...`,
   so only the generated `resource_bundle_accessor.swift` is prefix-mapped, it is left out of the
   cached diagnostics, and replay dereferences its missing buffer. All measurements above ran in
   a `/private/tmp` scratch directory, which is why they hit it. From a path under `$HOME`, the
   same `CmuxSettingsUI` chain with warnings on replayed all 179 hits in 31.9 s with no crash,
   and the minimal reproducer does not crash. Reported as swiftlang/swift#92545 with a
   three-file reproducer. Rule for fleet builds: never build under a symlinked path.
   (`SWIFT_SUPPRESS_WARNINGS=YES` in the results table was only needed because of the scratch
   location.) cmux CI runs Xcode 26.3/26.5, replays cached jobs alongside about 2,000 warnings
   without crashing, and is not affected.
2. **The protocol assumes a same-host service.** For large blobs the client sends
   `CASBytes.file_path`, a path on its own disk, not the bytes. With the service on Big Red over
   an SSH-forwarded socket, those uploads failed (`invalid argument … localcas-…/plugin/temp-…`),
   the fill took 223 s and uploaded 47 MB of 201 MB, and the next build hit 55 of 288. The
   round-trip time was about 100 ms, so this is also a wide-area worst case. Consequence: every
   machine runs a local cache daemon that Xcode talks to, and the daemon talks to the fleet.
   That is the tier design, now required.
3. **Index entries can reference missing objects.** In that wide-area run, entries landed for
   objects that never arrived (`makeBlob: missing object for ID`). Xcode rejected them and the
   build still passed, but the store must refuse an entry until every object it references is
   present: the staged-publication rule #1068 already uses.

## Cleanup

All prototype servers were stopped: local ones with SIGINT, and the Big Red one by exact PID
after its SSH forward exited. Scratch DerivedData, local CAS directories, stores, and the
extracted cmux sources live only in the session scratch directory. Big Red keeps
`~/scratch/fleet-cas` (source and build) and a 41 MB `~/scratch/fcas-store`; both can be
deleted and rebuilt from this branch. Nothing was installed and no service was registered.
