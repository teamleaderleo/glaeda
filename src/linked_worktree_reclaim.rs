//! Read-only observation and pure reclaim planning for linked Git worktrees.
//!
//! A linked worktree is not reconstructible the way a Cargo target is. It can hold the only copy of
//! uncommitted edits (including edits `git status` hides behind assume-unchanged or skip-worktree
//! index flags), untracked files, populated submodule repositories, an interrupted operation,
//! per-worktree refs, or a commit that no ref reaches. Authority here therefore comes from
//! preservation: everything the worktree holds must already exist elsewhere in the repository, or be
//! preservable by exactly one named compensation -- pinning a detached HEAD under a ref before
//! removal. Apparent idleness and a path that looks like scratch grant nothing; the idle window is a
//! grace period, not evidence.
//!
//! Outside the preservation guarantee, by design:
//!
//! - Ignored files. They are what makes worktrees expensive (`target/`, `node_modules/`), and
//!   `git worktree remove` discards them too, but ignore rules are repository-controlled, so an
//!   ignored file can still be unique local data such as a `.env`. Callers that act on a plan own
//!   that residual risk.
//! - History reached only through this worktree's reflog or `ORIG_HEAD`, which Git itself already
//!   treats as garbage once it expires.
//!
//! Shared refs mean branches, tags, and remote-tracking refs. `refs/stash`, prefetch refs, and other
//! worktrees' per-worktree refs are rewritten or dropped by routine commands, so they never count
//! as preservation.
//!
//! Planning performs no mutation and emits no paths. It consumes observations the caller took and
//! returns one decision with every veto that applied, so a refusal explains itself completely.
//! Observed facts are assembled from several reads at slightly different moments, so they are one
//! bounded observation, not an atomic snapshot. Nothing here removes a worktree; an executor must
//! re-observe immediately before acting and belongs behind its own destructive review.
